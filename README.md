# TriviaGame
Game of trivia with timer on answer responses. 
This game is focused on animated movie voices and composers, largely on the Lion King movies. 
It posed a challenge handling the clock functions such as setInterval and setTimeout, learning that js "on" functions may fire when the page is loaded, and why a function is not recognized by a new button.
Game starts with a Start button. When activated a series of questions with dropdown answers appear. Each question has a 10-second timer. When a selection is made, a message indicates if the question was right or wrong. Once all the questions have been displayed, a game summary appears with the option to try again.
